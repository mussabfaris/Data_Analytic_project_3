# World Population 2024 (Porject)

Overview:
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard focused on World Population Statistics. The dashboard offers insights into population distribution across continents and countries, migration patterns, median ages, and fertility rates as of 2024. The data visualization aids in understanding global population trends and demographic shifts.


## Feature 
•	Population by Continent & Country: Visual representation of total population numbers by continent and top countries.

•	Migration Patterns: Net migration statistics by continent, highlighting trends in population movement.

•	Median Age by Continent: Analysis of the median age across different regions, providing insights into population age distribution.

•	Fertility Rates: Comparison of fertility rates by continent.

•	Interactive Filters: Dynamic filtering options by continent and country for deeper analysis.

## Data Source
The data for this project was extracted from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/ . It includes population statistics, migration data, fertility rates, and demographic information for the year 2024.

## Project Steps
1.	Data Extraction: Data was sourced from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/ , ensuring it includes up-to-date and comprehensive global population statistics.
2.	Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, standardize formats, and ensure data integrity for accurate analysis.
3.	Data Loading into Tableau: The cleaned dataset was imported into Tableau for analysis.
4.	Data Analysis & Visualization: I performed an in-depth analysis using Tableau, creating an interactive dashboard to visualize global population trends and patterns.
5.	Key Insights Derived: The dashboard was designed to provide actionable insights on global demographics, helping to understand population distribution, migration changes, and age group trends.

## Technologies Used
