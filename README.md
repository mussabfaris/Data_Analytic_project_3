# World Population 2024 (Porject)

Overview:
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard focused on World Population Statistics. The dashboard offers insights into population distribution across continents and countries, migration patterns, median ages, and fertility rates as of 2024. The data visualization aids in understanding global population trends and demographic shifts.


## Feature 
•	Population by Continent & Country: Visual representation of total population numbers by continent and top countries.

•	Migration Patterns: Net migration statistics by continent, highlighting trends in population movement.

•	Median Age by Continent: Analysis of the median age across different regions, providing insights into population age distribution.

•	Fertility Rates: Comparison of fertility rates by continent.

•	Interactive Filters: Dynamic filtering options by continent and country for deeper analysis.

## Data Source
The data for this project was extracted from https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/ . It includes population statistics, migration data, fertility rates, and demographic information for the year 2024.
